		<h2>About Rachel</h2>
		<p>Rachel Greene lives in New York city with her best friend Monica. She used to serve coffee but now she works in fashion. Ever since she left her fiance Barry at the alter she has had a rough love life that consumers the majority of her personal life. She gave up the life of an orthodontists wife and declared financial freedom from her parents. Monica, her best friend, has an older brother Ross who was in love with Rachel since high school despite her chubby ankles and low aspirations but he fudged that up when he slept with Chloe the copy girl when he and rachel were "on a break". Since then she dated here and there and even married Ross while drunk in Vegas but then got a divorce. She went on to have a baby daughter with Ross named Emma. Her parents got a divorce a few years ago and hate eachother and both of her sisters are equally crappy people. Good thing she had Ross and her Friends <3.</p>
