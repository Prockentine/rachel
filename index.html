			<h2>About Rachel</h2>
			<p>Rachel Greene lives in New York city with her best friend Monica. She used to serve coffee but now she works in fashion. Ever since she left her fiance Barry at the alter she has had a rough love life that consumed the majority of her personal life. She gave up the life of an orthodontist's wife and declared financial freedom from her parents. Monica, her best friend, has an older brother Ross who was in love with Rachel since high school despite her chubby ankles and low career aspirations but he messed that up when he slept with Chloe the copy girl when he and Rachel were "on a break". Since then she dated here and there and eventually married Ross while drunk in Vegas but then got a divorce. She went on to have a daughter, Emma, with Ross and married him again. Her parents got a divorce a few years ago and they cannot stand each other. She also has two sisters, Jill and Amy, both of which are not good people due to their spoiled upbringing. Good thing she had Ross and her Friends <3.</p>

		<h2>The Big Debate: Rachel's Name</h2>
		<p>There's much debate surrounding the correct spelling of Rachel's last name.. is it spelled Green or Greene?<br>
		According to <a href="https://friends.fandom.com/wiki/Rachel_Greene" target="_blank"> Fandom.com</a> it's Greene. Her last name can be seen spelled as "Greene" in these three episodes:
			<ul>
				<li><i>"The One With The Invitation"</i> (S4,E21): on Rachel's invitation to Ross' wedding</li>
				<li><i>"The One Where Rachel Has A Baby"</i> (S8, E24): on the label of Emma's cradle in the hospital</li>
				<li><i>"The One With Phoebe's Rats"</i> (S9, E12): on Rachel's nameplate at Ralph Lauren</li></ul>
			Evidence of her last name being spelled "Green"...
			<ul>
				<li>There's also rumors that on some Warner Bros. press materials it's spelled as "Green"</li>
				<li>In the ending credits of the episodes where her parents, Leonard and Sandra, appear the family name is spelled "Green"</li>
				<li>In <i>"The One With The Cake"</i> (S10, E04), her name is written as "Green" on the box of Emma's birthday cake but its speculated that since she ordered over the phone it could be a spelling mistake by the bakery</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Fun Fact:</b> Her last name was actually supposed to be "Robbins" and it was mentioned in the first pilot episode by Ross but that line was eventually edited out of the episode.
